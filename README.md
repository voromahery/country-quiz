-   User story: I can see select an answer
-   User story: I can see if my answer is correct or incorrect
-   User story: When I answer correctly, I can move on to the next question
-   User story: When I answer incorrectly, I can see my results and try again
-   User story: I can try again

**Icon**: https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/

**API**: https://restcountries.eu/. Use data from the API to create questions and answers.

**Live app** : https://country-quiz-app.netlify.app/

As long as you fulfill all the user stories, you can give your personal touches by adding transition, using your own images, changing colors, or even creating your own layout,...

Once you completed, submit your solutions by providing URLs for both GitHub repository and live app on Netlify and explain briefly what you have done.

For the custom domain url you'll enter in netlify, please use the following naming convention : **country-quiz-_YOUR_FIRSTNAME_.netlify.app** (replace YOUR_FIRSTNAME by your firstname)

Good luck everybody!
